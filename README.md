# Go-Task
Go-Task is a task management system written in Golang. It is a service-oriented application that contains several services such as an authentication service, a user service, and a task service. Each service is isolated and does not have direct dependencies on other services. The application makes use of gRPC to handle service communication and PostgreSQL for persistent data storage.

## Services

### User Service
The user service is responsible for handling user-related and auth tasks. The service performs operations like creating a user, getting user details, and updating user information.
